# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.
3. (extra: Learn about what exactly Git is from [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).)

### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Part A. Plan 

To stage the interaction with your interactive device, think about:

_Setting:_ Where is this interaction happening? (e.g., a jungle, the kitchen) When is it happening?


_Players:_ Who is involved in the interaction? Who else is there? If you reflect on the design of current day interactive devices like the Amazon Alexa, it’s clear they didn’t take into account people who had roommates, or the presence of children. Think through all the people who are in the setting.


_Activity:_ What is happening between the actors?


_Goals:_ What are the goals of each player? (e.g., jumping to a tree, opening the fridge). 


The interactive device can be anything *except* a computer, a tablet computer or a smart phone, but the main way it interacts needs to be using light.

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*
Setting: the interaction happens in the bedroom
Players: player 1: the person who sleeps in the bedroom will be involved in the interaction. If he/she has a roommate, the roommate can also be involved in this interaction (player 2).
Activity: The user 1 and 2 are doing makeup for at home for an upcoming dance night. Both are busy with using brushes, eyeshadow palattes and are not able to adjust the mirror and the brightness in the room.
Goal: The goal of for each player is the same, where they can find a mirror that has different degree of lights to focus on their faces as they do makeup.

Sketch a storyboard of the interactions you are planning. It does not need to be perfect, but must get across the behavior of the interactive device and the other characters in the scene. 

\*\***Include a picture of your storyboard here**\*\*
https://github.com/angelachen-19/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2021/Angela_Chen_IDD_storyboard.jpeg?raw=true

Present your idea to the other people in your breakout room. You can just get feedback from one another or you can work together on the other parts of the lab.

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

I was able to showcase my storyboard and idea to a classmate and who provided some thoughtful feedback:
1. Thinking about add a stand or a supported structure on the mirror so that it can safely placed on any surface without the person holding it or falling off.
2. thinking about adding a subsequent voice control feature where the user can adjust the color mode of the light (i.e. warm or cold colors, blue, orange, etc.)



## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

1. We need to make sure the size of the portable mirror. Some mirror size is too large to be placed in somewhere in the room where the player might be place to use for makeup.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

1. think about how to make sure that the portable mirror can be placed anywhere in the bedroom where players are doing for makeup, rather than sitting in front of the dress table. New ideas include a adds-on stand or equipment that allows the mirror to adjust to different surfaces.
2. think about what are the charging method for the mirror, using wires or batteries?


## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can can manually or remotely control.

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*

I have issues running Tinkerbelle on mac so I decided to simply use phone and flashlights to conduct the video. The video is at the part F.



## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

I invited a classmate, Jiahao Dong (jd787) who helped me set up the scenario at the home. What I prepared for the set-up included makeups lotions, a phone that displayed the light and changes the brightness, as well as an ipad that serves to control the color and light changes. 

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*

The prototype will be updated with more details that show how and when the mirror lights will change in brightness as users talk over it, such as "level 1, level 2, and level 3". The updated prototype will be shown as in the recording in Part F.


## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop a costume so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**\*\*

https://github.com/angelachen-19/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2021/Angela_Chen_IDD_PartE.jpg

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*
1. I'm concerning that if the portable mirror is only equipped with batteries or something else too. It is better not to equip with wires as I want to place the mirror on any surface.
2. I was thinking of whether the voice control needs a triggering word, or otherwise how can the mirror know that the user is talking to it?


## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*
the video to my prototyped interaction: https://youtu.be/1i6i25Paui4

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design. 
I was working on this lab by myself during the entire process, including brainstorming and sketching. Jiahao Dong (jd787) helped me set up the space for my video recording.


# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*
Both reviewers claimed that they loved my idea of a portable voice mirror, and some of the feedback I receive include: 
1) making sure that the portable mirror is a smart mirror that adjusts brightness based on user's needs, and it can learn what kind of lighting the user needs for each step. 
2) to consider how many degrees of brightness should the mirror have in its setting that can accomodate most of the user scenarios.

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
Scenario: I will keep the setting the same as in the staging 1 where the smart portable mirror is located in the bedroom. Players still remain the same, two roommates who will be able to share the mirror. Of course, this mirror can interact with any single player. I'd love to keep the same activity as the original as well, in which two girls (roommates) are doing the makeup at home for an upcoming dance night. They are busy with own makeup, with tons of brushes, eyeshadow palattes, lotion bottles. While there's only one chandelier in the dorm bedroom, none of them has additional hand to hold the lamp or mirror, so they find it hard to see how they look like when doing makeup.

Goal: The goal is to allow two girls to find a mirror that has different degree of lights, as well as some various colors to focus on their faces as they do makeup. Different colors can stand for various scenarios which allow them to determine the quality of their makeup. The mirror is smart and portable and can fit to stand on any horizontal surface.

Some additional instructions: I'll use primarily three colors, yellow, orange and green, in addition to the original setup where players control the brightness levels using voice. They now can also control the colors by commanding the voice with words, "red", "yellow", and "orange". Players can control the angle of the smart mirror by voice commanding. The details of the new mirror are in the sketch below.

Storyboard: I will remain the storyboard as the original, and has been described as the scenario above.
Update: in this stage, I will focus on updating the features and structures of the smart portable mirror based on peer review feedback. Here are some sketches of the mirror in different angles:

I also created a new video that explains how the new idea works. Thanks to Qianzhi Xu (qx36) who provided support of color displaying for people who cannot set up at their Mac OS devices. The link to my prototyped interaction is: https://youtu.be/vGymkhMXv-c
